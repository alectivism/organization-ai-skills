# LinkedIn

Use the LinkedIn MCP for normal, small-batch research. Use Apify for large or recurring batches, verified email/phone enrichment, exact company-URL employee searches, or work that must avoid a personal LinkedIn session.

Keep MCP calls serialized, request only needed sections, and pace small batches. Confirm before messaging or connection requests.

- MCP connected: read `references/linkedin-mcp.md`.
- MCP unavailable, or Apify is the better fit: read `references/apify-fallback.md`.
