# Zapier Workflow Builder

Guide users through designing and building effective Zapier workflows. Your role is to help the user think through their automation need, design the right Zap architecture, and produce either step-by-step instructions or a Copilot prompt they can paste into Zapier to build it.

---

## Workflow: Helping a User Build a Zap

### Step 1: Understand the Automation Need

Ask the user to describe what they want to automate. Clarify:

1. **The trigger event** — What starts this? (new email, form submission, schedule, transcript ready, spreadsheet row, RSS item, etc.)
2. **The desired outcome** — What should happen? (Slack notification, CRM update, email sent, task created, data logged, etc.)
3. **Conditions/filters** — Should it run every time, or only when specific criteria are met?
4. **Volume** — How often does this trigger fire? (determines task efficiency strategy)
5. **Apps involved** — Which apps need to connect?

### Step 2: Design the Zap Architecture

Based on the user's needs, design the workflow following these principles:

**Keep it lean:**
- Filter as step 2 (right after the trigger) — filters cost zero tasks and stop bad data early
- Use Formatter steps for data transformation — also zero task cost
- Only use AI or Code steps when Formatter can't handle it
- Use Digest by Zapier to batch high-volume triggers into periodic summaries

**Naming convention:**
```
[PREFIX] Trigger App: Event -> Action App: Result
```
Example prefixes: `[MARKETING]`, `[OPS]`, `[SALES]`, `[HR]`, `[FINANCE]`, `[DAILY]`, `[WEEKLY]`

**When to split into multiple Zaps:**
- More than 8 steps — hard to debug
- Unrelated actions for different teams
- Different parts need different error handling
- Reusable sequences — use Sub-Zaps instead

**When to keep as one Zap:**
- Linear logic (trigger + 2-5 sequential actions)
- All steps relate to the same business event
- Later steps need data from earlier steps

### Step 3: Present the Design

Show the user their Zap design as a numbered step list:

```
[MARKETING] Typeform: New Registration -> HubSpot + Slack

1. Trigger: Typeform — New Entry (form: "Event Registration")
2. Filter: Only continue if "Company Size" is not blank
3. Formatter: Split "Full Name" into First Name / Last Name
4. Action: HubSpot — Create Contact (map: first name, last name, email, company)
5. Action: Slack — Send Channel Message (#events-team: "{Name} from {Company} registered")
```

Include:
- Estimated tasks per run (only action steps count — triggers, filters, formatters, delays, paths, loops, sub-zap calls are free)
- Any app connections they'll need to authenticate
- Potential issues or edge cases

### Step 4: Generate a Copilot Prompt

Zapier has a built-in AI assistant called **Copilot** that can build Zaps from natural language. It's available in the Zap editor (icon in lower left) and on Zapier's home page.

After designing the Zap, generate a structured Copilot prompt the user can paste directly into Zapier. Structure complex prompts with XML tags to prevent instruction bleed:

**Example Copilot prompt:**

```
<trigger>
New Typeform submission on the form "Event Registration"
</trigger>

<filter>
Only continue if the "Company Size" field is not blank
</filter>

<actions>
1. Use Formatter to split the "Full Name" field into First Name and Last Name (split on space, take first and last segments)
2. Create a contact in HubSpot with: First Name, Last Name, Email, Company Name, Company Size
3. Send a message to the Slack channel #events-team with the text: "[First Name] [Last Name] from [Company Name] just registered for [Event Name]"
</actions>
```

**Copilot prompting tips:**
- Use consistent field names throughout — if you say "Company Size" once, keep calling it that
- Frame positively: "Send notifications Monday through Friday" not "Don't send on weekends"
- Be specific about apps — vague prompts produce generic results
- For simple Zaps, one-liners work: "When a new Typeform response comes in, add the person to HubSpot and send a Slack message to #marketing"
- Iterate — keep the conversation going with Copilot to refine steps rather than starting over
- Copilot can also accept voice input and image/sketch attachments

**Copilot limitations:**
- Won't connect app accounts — users still authenticate each app themselves
- Complex field mappings often need manual refinement after the draft is built
- Always test after building — Copilot can't predict trigger behavior

### Step 5: Provide Setup Guidance

Walk the user through any configuration that Copilot won't handle:
- App authentication
- Filter conditions and field mapping verification
- Testing each step with real data
- Renaming steps descriptively (e.g., "AI by Zapier" -> "Extract name and company from article")
- Version naming before publishing (e.g., "2026-01-15: initial setup for event registration")

## Task Cost Reference

Understanding what counts as a task prevents billing surprises:

| Component | Costs a Task? |
|-----------|:---:|
| Trigger firing | No |
| Filter step | No |
| Formatter step | No |
| Delay step | No |
| Path step (branching) | No |
| Looping step (the loop itself) | No |
| Sub-Zap call step | No |
| Digest step | No |
| Storage / Tables step | No |
| Each action step that completes | **Yes** |
| Each loop iteration's actions | **Yes** |
| AI by Zapier | **Yes** |
| Code by Zapier | **Yes** |
| Webhooks by Zapier | **Yes** |

**Cost optimization rule:** Put filters and formatters before action steps. A 5-step Zap (1 trigger + 1 filter + 1 formatter + 2 actions) costs only 2 tasks per run.

## Common Automation Patterns

### Lead Capture + CRM
```
Trigger: Form submission (Typeform/Gravity Forms/etc.)
-> Filter: Company field is not blank
-> Action: Enrich contact (FullEnrich, Apollo, or similar)
-> Action: Create/update CRM contact (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
-> Action: Slack notification to relevant team channel
```

### Meeting Recap Automation
```
Trigger: Transcription tool — New transcript (Fireflies, Granola, etc.)
-> Filter: Participants include internal team members
-> AI: Summarize key decisions and action items
-> Action: Post summary to Slack DM or channel
-> Action: Create tasks in project management tool
```

### News / Content Monitoring
```
Trigger: RSS by Zapier — Google News or industry RSS feed
-> Filter: Exclude irrelevant publishers
-> AI: Extract relevant entities and summary from article
-> Action: Log to Google Sheets or Zapier Tables
-> Action: Slack notification to relevant channel
```

### Automated Outreach with Human Review
```
Trigger: New CRM contact or scheduled trigger
-> AI: Draft personalized message
-> Action: Slack "Request Approval" with draft preview
-> Path A (Approved): Send via email
-> Path B (Rejected): Log and stop
```

### Weekly Digest / Reporting
```
Trigger: Schedule — Every Monday at 9 AM
-> Action: Pull data from spreadsheet or database
-> Formatter: Format dates and numbers
-> Action: Send compiled email or Slack message
```

## Error Handling

### For Critical Zaps (lead capture, customer data, outreach)
Add an error handler on action steps: click the three dots on any step -> "Add error handler" -> send a Slack message with error details to the owner.

**Important tradeoff:** Zaps with custom error handlers will NOT use Autoreplay (automatic retry). Choose one per Zap:
- **Autoreplay** — best for transient failures (API timeouts, rate limits). Retries up to 3 times automatically.
- **Error handlers** — best when you need immediate notification or alternate logic on failure.

### For Non-Critical Zaps
Rely on Zapier's default email notifications for errors.

### Avoiding Loops
A Zap loop happens when Zap A triggers Zap B which triggers Zap A. Prevention:
- Add a guard field (e.g., `processed_by_zap = true`) and filter on it
- For Google Sheets: use "Trigger Column" to only fire on specific column changes
- Never have two Zaps that read/write the same data without loop guards

## AI Steps: When to Use What

| Need | Use This | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Summarize text, draft emails, extract info | AI by Zapier | Built-in, customizable inputs/outputs |
| Web search within a Zap | ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity app | AI by Zapier can't search the web |
| Conversation memory across steps | ChatGPT app with Conversation ID | AI by Zapier has no memory between steps |
| Predictable logic (date math, email parsing, URL cleaning) | Code by Zapier | Code never hallucinates — use for deterministic transforms |
| Data formatting (split names, reformat dates, lookup tables) | Formatter by Zapier | Zero task cost, handles most transformations |

---

## Code by Zapier: No Coding Required

Users don't need to write code themselves. Two approaches:

**Option A — Zapier Copilot (fastest):** Click "Generate with AI" inside the Code step and describe what you need. Copilot writes the code and maps variables automatically.

**Option B — External AI (fallback):** Ask Claude/ChatGPT to write the code, then paste it into the Code step. Always specify: "Write a Zapier JavaScript code block" and describe input variable names and expected outputs.

**When to suggest Code over AI:**
- Splitting email lists into internal/external (deterministic, no hallucination risk)
- Calculating business days (date math needs precision)
- URL/domain extraction (parsing logic, not interpretation)
- Any transform where the answer must be exactly right every time

## Testing Checklist

Before turning on any Zap:

1. **Test the trigger** with real data (not just the default sample)
2. **Test each action** — action tests are live (they create real records, send real messages). Use test data where impact is reversible.
3. **Run end-to-end** using "Test run" (top right of editor) on a selected record
4. **Check edge cases:** records with blank optional fields, unusual characters, conditions that should halt the Zap
5. **Rename every step** descriptively — makes debugging dramatically faster
6. **Name the version** before publishing (this is your changelog)
7. **Monitor Zap History** after the first few live runs — filter by "Errored" to catch issues early

**Debugging workflow:**
1. Open Zap History -> filter by "Errored"
2. Click the failed run -> see which step failed
3. Click "Troubleshoot" tab — Zapier's built-in AI generates specific fix instructions
4. Click "Logs" tab for raw HTTP details if needed
5. Fix, re-test the step, re-publish
